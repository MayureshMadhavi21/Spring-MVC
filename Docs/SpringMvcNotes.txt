 Spring MVC Application Creation Steps
 Configure the dispatcher servlet in web.xml
 Create Spring configuration file.(inside web-inf > spring-servlet.xml) > name should be > servlet_name-servlet.xml
 servlet_name is DispatcherServlet name which is <servlet-name>spring</servlet-name>
 Configure View Resolver(InternalResourceViewResolver) > (inside spring-servlet.xml)
 ex - /WEB-INF/views/hello.jsp
 Create Controller.
 Create a view.
 
 
JSP Scripting elements
The scripting elements provides the ability to insert java code inside the jsp. There are three types of scripting elements
A scriptlet tag is used to execute java source code in JSP

Syntax:- <%  java source code %> 
<body>  
<% out.print("welcome to jsp"); %>  
</body>  

The code placed within JSP expression tag is written to the output stream of the response. So you need not write out.print() to write data. It is mainly used to print the values of variable or method.

Syntax:- <%=  statement %>  
<body>  
<%= "welcome to jsp" %>  
</body>
